# -Flight-Delay-Prediction-Project
Millions of people fly every day, and flight delays can be an unwelcome aspect of air travel. Just how often do flight delays occur?  In this project, you will work with airport flight data and explore how the day of week affects the likelihood of a delayed departure.
# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting flight delays using historical flight data. It involves data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and building machine learning models to classify whether a flight is likely to be delayed.

## üìå Project Highlights

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight data
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset
- Engineered relevant features (e.g., time of day, airline, origin/destination)
- Built classification models to predict delays
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## üìÅ Files Included

- `flights-delays-project.ipynb` ‚Äî main notebook with all code and output
- *(You need to add your dataset separately if not embedded in the notebook)*

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- Label Encoding, Train/Test Split, Confusion Matrix

## üß† Problem Statement

Airline delays disrupt travel plans and cause economic loss. Predicting delays can help airlines optimize operations and passengers make informed decisions. This project builds a model to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on various factors.
